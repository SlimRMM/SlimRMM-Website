      },
      "migration": {
        "q": "Can I switch from another RMM?",
        "a": "Yes, SlimRMM can run alongside existing solutions. Our agents are lightweight and don't interfere with other software."
      },
      "standalone": {
        "q": "Are the RMM instances completely standalone?",
        "a": "Yes, each SlimRMM instance is fully independent. There's no central cloud component or telemetry. Your data never leaves your infrastructure or your chosen hosting environment."
      },
      "support": {
        "q": "What support do I get?",

      },
      "updates": {
        "q": "How are updates performed?",

      },
      "scaling": {
        "q": "How does the solution scale?",
        "a": "SlimRMM was built for performance. A single server can manage thousands of agents. For larger deployments, we're happy to advise."
      },
      "proxmox": {
        "q": "How does the Proxmox integration work?",
        "a": "Agents on Proxmox hosts automatically detect the virtualization environment. You can start, stop and monitor VMs and containers directly from the dashboard."
